# PROJECT MIDST (KENYA SPACE AGENCY)

Project MIDST (Monitoring for Information and Decisions using Space Technology) is an initiative by Kenya Space Agency that seeks to support the National and County Government institutions to address the gaps and challenges highlighted in the assessment report on hardware, software, human resource and spatial data. The aim of the project is to use new and advancing geospatial technologies to co-develop various Earth Observation products and applications, with stakeholders, that could be used by the stakeholders to achieve certain goals within their mandate.
Through project MIDST, the Agency is exploring the possibilities of developing systems and applications to enhance the uptake and utilization of space derived data and information for decision making. The project focuses on developing products on the following areas of application; Natural Resource Management (Forests), Spatial Planning (Urbanization), Disaster Management (Floods/Landslides).

## PROJECT MIDST FOCUS AREAS

1. Natural Resource Management

Our natural resources play an important role in developing the country’s socio-economic values. Management of natural resources involves monitoring and conserving naturally occurring resources within the country such as forest, marine ecosystems, mineral regions and biodiversity. Take for example forest cover across the country, which are essential in the production of goods, protection of soil, water and other environmental services, conservation of biodiversity, provision of socio-cultural services, livelihood support and a stabilizing force for the climate, require sustainable management which will enhance a positive impact in the development of the country’s socio-economic status.
2. Urbanization & Spatial planning

The country’s urban areas are on a rapid growth. High rate of urbanization if not planned well leads to uncontrolled sprouting of informal settlements with poor social, economic and environmental conditions. Project MIDST shall incorporate space data and geospatial technologies to build an application that will inform the relevant stakeholders on how to conduct proper spatial planning of our urban areas.
3. Disaster and Risk Management

Disaster management cuts across various fields involving monitoring and controlling damages that may occur due to floods, landslides and earthquakes, oil spillage and forest fires.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT MIDST

Through the use of geospatial technologies, project MIDST explores the concept of monitoring the Earth’s surface (land cover and land use) and the changes that occur over time. Project MIDST was initiated in July 2020 by the Kenya Space Agency with the vision to primarily leverage on free and open-source data, platforms and systems to enable decision makers to make informed decisions grounded on data. Again, the initiation of this project has assisted and will continue supporting the counties and the country to monitor and report progress being made in the realization of SDG goals and targets, more particularly the ones listed below;

Zero hunger (SDG 2)
Clean water and sanitation(SDG 6)
Clean energy (SDG 7)
Industry, innovation and infrastructure (SDG 9)
Sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11)
Climate Action (SDG13)
Life Under Water ( SDG 14)
Life on Land (SDG 15)
